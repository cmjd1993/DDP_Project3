# DDP_Project3

This is my final submission for the Developing Data Products Course on Coursera.

I have created a webpage (https://cmjd1993.shinyapps.io/DDP3/) that displays an interative map of US Arrests in 1973 by State. This was made using the USArrests Dataset from the datasets package in R. 

The webpage was made via shiny. My ui.R and server.R files are included in this repos.
